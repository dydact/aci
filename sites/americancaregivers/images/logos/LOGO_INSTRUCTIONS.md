# iris EMR Logo Creation Instructions

## Logo Files Needed

1. **login_logo.gif** - Main logo displayed on the login screen
   - Current location: `sites/americancaregivers/images/login_logo.gif`
   - Dimensions should match the original (approximately 300x110 pixels)

2. **logo_1.png** - Small logo displayed in the top-left corner after login
   - Current location: `sites/americancaregivers/images/logo_1.png`
   - Dimensions should match the original (approximately 30x30 pixels)

3. **logo_2.png** - Text logo displayed next to logo_1
   - Current location: `sites/americancaregivers/images/logo_2.png`
   - Dimensions should match the original (approximately 100x30 pixels)

## Design Guidelines

- Based on the provided dydact logos:
  - `/Users/dydact/Desktop/dydact/logos/LOGO.png` - Favicon
  - `/Users/dydact/Desktop/dydact/logos/dydactlogocard.png` - Banner

- For the "iris" logo:
  - Use the same font style as the dydact logo
  - Use the text "iris," with the comma as specified in the configuration
  - Follow the same color scheme as the dydact logo
  - Consider incorporating a simple iris flower symbol if appropriate

## Placeholder Strategy

Currently, placeholder logos have been copied from the default OpenEMR installation. These should be replaced with custom "iris" logos according to the above specifications.

## Prescription Logo

The Rx.png file used for prescriptions is also copied to this directory for reference. Consider whether this needs to be updated to match the "iris" branding.
